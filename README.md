# Welcome to Sharktower 2.0

This is the container for the playground for the basis for Angular 2.0.

The purpose is to start stubbing out new parts of the application such as: 

- Login / Authentication
- Basic utilities
    - API connections
    - Back end setup
- Configuring of administration suite
- 

## How to: 

- To start compiling the typescript enter: ````npm run tsc````
- This will start the app running in node, and fire up the chrome tab to see it (automatically, awesome)

## Extras:

- **Arctic Typescript** https://github.com/Phaiax/ArcticTypescript
    - Typescript sublime 3 plugin
